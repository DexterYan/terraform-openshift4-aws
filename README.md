# Automated OpenShift v4 installation on AWS

This project automates the Red Hat Openshift Container Platform 4.2 installation on Amazon AWS platform. It focuses on the Openshift User-provided infrastructure installation (UPI) where end users provide pre-existing infrastructure including VMs, networking, load balancers, DNS configuration etc.

## Infrastructure Architecture

For detail on OpenShift UPI, please reference the following:


* [https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws_user_infra/installing-aws-user-infra.html](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws_user_infra/installing-aws-user-infra.html)
* [https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/aws/install_upi.md](https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/aws/install_upi.md)


The following diagram outlines the infrastructure architecture.


## Terraform Automation

This project uses mainly Terraform as infrastructure management and installation automation driver. All the user provisioned resource are created via the terraform scripts in this project.

### Prerequisites

1. To use Terraform automation, download the Terraform binaries [here](https://www.terraform.io/).

   On MacOS, you can acquire it using [homebrew](brew.sh) using this command:

   ```bash
   brew install terraform
   ```

   We recommend to run Terraform automation from an AWS bastion host because the installation will place the entire OpenShift cluster in a private network where you might not have easy access to validate the cluster installation from your laptop.

   Provision an EC2 bastion instance (with public and private subnets).
   Install Terraform binary.
   Install git

   ```bash
   sudo yum intall git-all
   git --version
   ```

   Install OpenShift command line `oc` cli:

   ```bash
   wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/openshift-client-linux-4.x.xx.tar.gz
   tar -xvf openshift-client-linux-4.x.xx.tar.gz
   chmod u+x oc kubectl
   sudo mv oc /usr/local/bin
   sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin
   oc version
   ```

   You'll also need the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-bundle.html) to do this.

2. Get the Terraform code

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-aws.git
   ```

3. Prepare the DNS 

   OpenShift requires a valid DNS doamin, you can get one from AWS Route53 or using existing domain and registrar.


4. Prepare AWS Account Access

   Please reference the [Required AWS Infrastructure components](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws_user_infra/installing-aws-user-infra.html#installation-aws-user-infra-requirements_installing-aws-user-infra) to setup your AWS account before installing OpenShift 4.

   We suggest to create an AWS IAM user dedicated for OpenShift installation with permissions documented above.
   On the bastion host, configure your AWS user credential as environment variables:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=RKXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=LXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/ng
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2

    aws s3 ls
   ```
