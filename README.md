The following diagram outlines the infrastructure architecture.


## Terraform Automation

This project uses mainly Terraform as infrastructure management and installation automation driver. All the user provisioned resource are created via the terraform scripts in this project.

### Prerequisites

1. To use Terraform automation, download the Terraform binaries [here](https://www.terraform.io/).

   On MacOS, you can acquire it using [homebrew](brew.sh) using this command:

   ```bash
   brew install terraform
   ```
